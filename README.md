## Explaining BookMe
#### BookMe is a software that I developed using python for the CS50P course. 
#### Its main use is to act as a booking assistant for users that want to book flights all over Italy. As in Italy, there is a lot of traffic on the highway, being able to quickly book flights instead of using the car, can make transfers quicker enabling people to reach their preferred destination with ease. This can increase tourism in Italy because often people decide not to move around in Italy to avoid congestion and being stuck in traffic. In Italy there are very nice cities, in some, you can visit very nice museums, in other, you can ski in the mountains and in some others you can swim in the sea. Based on the weather you can decide if you prefer to read a book in the sun or to have a walk in the mountains.
#### The software uses a list containing the most famous and used airports in Italy based on recent research. It shows all the possible flights a user can book within this nation. The software is very easy to use and understand and even its design is simple. 
#### BookMe was developed using only libraries already implemented in Python and therefore it doesn't have any requirements to run. 
> I chose to develop this software because I think that nowadays booking flights has become too complex and I think that a program similar to this could make the process easier and more accessible to everybody. This program is designed to book flights in Italy but it could be easily used on a more global scale by upgrading the airport list.

## How does the program work?

#### The program uses four different functions with four different roles. The first function prompts the user to enter his credentials. The program will ask for the user's name, birthdate, nationality, and passport number. The second function will display the airport list to the user prompting him to choose a starting and landing location. After this, the third function will display the times of departure of the flights connecting the chosen locations and the user will be prompted to choose one. The fourth function will then prompt the user for his payment credentials including the type of card, the card number, its expiration date, and its security code. For Paypal users, the program will ask the Paypal's account email or username and password. The program follows a simple structure and it implements a lot of while loops. It's a relatively simple code that can be read and understood by every type of programmer.

## Requirements

#### To run the program the user doesn't need to install anything as long as he has a newer version of python already installed on his computer. If the user doesn't have python on his computer, he can install it by entering this command in the computer's terminal.
