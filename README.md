## Explaining BookMe
#### BookMe is a software that I developed using python for the CS50P course. 
#### Its main use is to act like a booking assistant for users that want to book flights all over the world. 
#### The software uses a list containing the most famous and used airports in the world to show all the possible flights a user can book. The software is very easy to use and understand and even its design is simple. 
#### BookMe was developed using only libraries already implemented in Python and therefore it doesn't have any requirements to run. 
> I chose to develop this software because I think that nowadays booking flights has become too complex and I think that a program similar to this could make the process easier and more accessible to everybody.
